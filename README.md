# Live-Chat-Application

This is a simple Java Swing-based chat application that allows two users to communicate with each other over a network. The application consists of a server and two client applications (User  1 and User 2) that can send and receive messages in real-time.

## Features

- **Message Display**: Messages are displayed in a text pane for easy reading.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts

## Usage
- Start the server first.
- Then, start both client applications (User 1 and User 2).
- Type messages in the text field and press "Send" or hit Enter to send messages.
- Messages will be displayed in the chat window for both users.
